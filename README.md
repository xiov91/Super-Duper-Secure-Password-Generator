# Super-Duper-Secure-Password-Generator

A password generator that can change the output depending on the user's choices!

It would have been an astounding project, had I been able to finish it. Unfortunately, I won't have the time tomorrow, the last day, so the code is very rough. It contains the working functions for each feature, however my difficulties came when I tried to put them together, let alone work it into something that would read it and generate the output. I fully intend to come back to this and finish it, but for the sake of the assignment, this is as far as I can go on time.
